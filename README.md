# Iconify Design Flutter 🚀

`iconify_design_flutter` is a Flutter package that allows you to use icons from [Iconify](https://icon-sets.iconify.design). It caches icons locally after the first fetch, making subsequent loads instant.

---

## 📌 Features

✔️ Fetches SVG icons dynamically from Iconify.
✔️ Caches icons locally for faster future loads.
✔️ Supports custom size and color.

---

## 📦 Installation

Add the package to your `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  iconify_design_flutter: ^1.0.1
```

Run:

```sh
flutter pub get
```

---

## 🚀 Usage

Import the package:

```dart
import 'package:iconify_design_flutter/iconify_design_flutter.dart';
```

Use the `IconifyIcon` widget:

```dart
IconifyIcon(
  icon: "mdi:home",
  color: Colors.black,
  size: 32,
)
```

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

- Extracts the prefix and icon name from the provided string (e.g., `"mdi:home"`).
- Checks if the icon is already cached locally.
- If not cached, fetches the SVG from Iconify and stores it.
- On subsequent renders, loads the cached icon instead of fetching it again.
